# Custom Security Health Analytics Modules

These are custom detectors written for Google Cloud's Security Command Center.

*"With custom modules, you can extend Security Health Analytics's detection capabilities by creating custom detectors that scan the Google Cloud resources and policies that you specify using rules that you define to check for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or compliance violations."*
